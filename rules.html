                           team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from 
                           this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey

                            minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will 
                            assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board 
                            whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams 
                            from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable 
                            field may be required to play all their games away.</p></li>
